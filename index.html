<p style="text-align:center;">
  My Name is Bladymir Tellez, and I am a Computer Science student at the <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">University of California,
  Irvine</a>. You can usually find me trying out challanges on <a href="http://www.hackerrank.com">HackerRank</a>, reading, coding, or cooking up something delicious.
<br>
<br>
  This blog serves as a way for me to share knowledge, and experience I gather over time, 
  Which will boild down to: algorithms, application development, functional programming, and some theoretical stuff I hope I get right.
