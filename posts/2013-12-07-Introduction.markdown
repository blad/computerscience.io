## Introduction
My name is Bladymir, I am a student at the University of California, Irvine 
studying Computer Science. I am absolutely blown away at the wonderful 
things that computer science as a whole has brought us since its early inception.

I enjoy reading about the history, and I really enjoy listening to the truely
passionate people who have been involved in the field over the last 20, 30 or 40+
years and have been witness to some of the mind blowing changes that have come to 
the field.

## This Site
This site is my aim at documenting some of my experiences in Computer Science, so
that I may share my experience with others, and so that I can also look back and
remember of what I have learned.

The more I explore Computer Science, the more I see that the field is broader than
it was when I started out or could have ever imagined. Computer Science is a very 
dynamic field and will continue to change at a rapid pace, but still there will be
some core principles that shall remain relatively constant.
