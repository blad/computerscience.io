Blog on Computer Science Topics

This is the source code for my blog: ComputerScience.io which is statically generated 
using [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). 

This will explore some of my random explorations of the field in general, and maybe serve
as a reminder of things I have learned, in hope that I can refer to them in searchable format
via google or `grep`, rather than flipping through endless pages of paper notes.
